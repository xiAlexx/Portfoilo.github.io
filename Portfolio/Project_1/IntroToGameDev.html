    <h1>Game Development</h1>

    <h2>What is Game Development?</h2>

    <p>Video game creation has come a long way since the days of 8-bit games created by small teams or even a single person. Many modern video games have teams of people working on them year-round. These games are expected to immerse us in their stories and gameplay using audio-visuals equal to the quality of major motion pictures. Even games created by a small team, or a single person, can reach a quality that wasn't even feasible not so long ago.</p>

    <p>In my course work, you will be taken through the process of video game development, from design and gameplay to art and sounds assets, and finally, the tools of the trade. The content in this course requires no previous knowledge, and anyone interested in the topic should feel comfortable exploring this course at their desired pace.</p>

    <h2>What Will I learn Reading This?</h2>

    <p>By reading my course, you should be able to achieve the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Understand the video game design process, from generating an idea to choosing the proper hardware.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Understand the concepts behind gameplay development, such as game mechanics, artificial intelligence, and practical user experiences.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Understanding the design and creation of video game art and sound assets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Understand the programming languages and tools used during video game production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Every game begins with an idea! And this idea can come from anything. It can come from a personal experience you had and you think, “Hey! This could be a fun game to play”. It can come from an already existing game that you add your own fun little twist to.</p>

    <p>In my course work, we will explore how to bring your game idea to life, including the following topics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Game types</li>
        <br>
        <li>User experience</li>
        <br>        
        <li>Objective design</li>
        <br>
        <li>Game parameters</li>
        <br>
        <li>Game aesthetics</li>
        <br>
        <li>Game platform</li>
        <br>            
        <li>Game controls</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The chess grandmaster Robert “Bobby” Fischer felt that players were over-preparing for games of chess by memorizing a series of moves from the starting position.</p>

    <p>To prevent this, Bobby Fischer proposed a variant which is shown above. Chess 960, where the pieces were randomized, forces a player to think on their feet. This is an example of a new game derived from a classic one.</p>

    <p>By the end of this, you should be well equipped to turn your idea into a game design.</p>

    <h1>Game Type</h1>

    <p>Before we define rules or start sketching out game art, we must first consider what type of game we are trying to make. Once we determine what game type we want to make, we can start working on its other aspects.</p>

    <p>The following is a list of some of the most common game types:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Platformer: a player controls a character that has to run and jump on platforms while avoiding obstacles.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA): multiple players face off in an arena-style environment.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sports: a representation of a current or made-up sport.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Role-playing game (RPG): players assume different kinds of fictional characters and play through a story.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Puzzles: solving problems and puzzles through specific challenges.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Puzzles: solving problems and puzzles through specific challenges.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Action/Adventure: high-paced game with the character going through a series of quests or missions.</li>        
    </ul>

    <p>These are some common game types, but over the years, many types have evolved to make new exciting game types.</p>

    <p>When designing a game, selecting the game type can depend on your initial idea or preferences. For example, do you want to create a game where the character has to solve missions to win? This might be an action-adventure game. Do you want to make a game where players can control characters that face off in an arena? You might design a MOBA game. Do you want to create a fictional world where players can assume different fictional roles? You might make an RPG. We must clearly define things like this at the beginning of the design process.</p>

    <h2>Player Experience</h2>

    <p>One of the most important things to consider in game design is the player's experience while playing our game. Generally, we want to design a game that someone will enjoy playing.</p>

    <p>To create a fun game, we will have to consider the following things: human emotions, the challenge a game presents, and the player's game preferences.</p>

    <h2>Emotion</h2>

    <p>One of the critical elements of the human condition that we must consider is emotion. Think about the last time you played a game and won. Did that not feel good? Did it make you want to play again?</p>

    <p>What about when you lost? Did you want to go back and try again? When creating a game, we must remember what emotions we want our players to experience.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>

    <p>A game is considered enjoyable if it is the right amount of “challenging.” It shouldn't be so easy that it will be boring, and it shouldn't be so complex that it will feel hopeless to win. This is accomplished by presenting the player with a problem to solve. Once a player passes this challenge, they will feel good.</p>

    <p>The harder the challenge, the more satisfying solving it will be! But if the challenge is too hard, the player will likely quit in frustration. Finding the perfect balance will require some trial and error.</p>

    <h2>Player's Preference</h2>

    <p>What we, as the game creators, may find awesome might not come across that way to our intended player. Consider age, culture, and a player's preferences when designing a game.</p>

    <p>Popular games are considered “addicting” because they do an excellent job of balancing the player experience. Angry Birds and Flappy Bird are two very addictive mobile games. They achieved this by balancing out the player's emotional response, the game challenge, and player preferences.</p>

    <p>We should keep these in mind when designing a game.</p>

    <h1>Game Objectives</h1>

    <p>Once we have decided on the game type and what experience we want, it is time to consider the objective. Every game has an end goal or something the player needs to accomplish. Without this, there wouldn't be much interest in playing our game.</p>

    <p>When considering what objective to design, we must be consistent with the player experience we wish to create. We want to design an objective that will make someone happy when they achieve a goal or beat our game. Some common goals and sub-goals include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Completing a puzzle in the lowest amount of time possible (Puzzle or strategy game)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Beating a “boss” to advance to the next level (Action/Adventure game)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Finding some hidden key or treasure that will unlock more powers or accessories (Action/Adventure game or RPG)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Completing a side mission (Action/Adventure game or RPG)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Score the most points in a game (Sports)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Along with the primary objective, a game can also have some sub-objectives. During gameplay, the player must complete these sub-missions (or side-quests). They are crucial because they keep the player engaged and add extra content.</p>

    <p>An optional sub-objective will offer an interested player more things to do in our game and allow a casual player to complete the game more quickly. Carefully crafting sub-objectives will make the game more fun for the player.</p>

    <p>In Pokemon Sword and Shield the overall objective is to defeat different Gym Leaders to become the Pokemon League Champion. The sub-objectives throughout the series (and most Pokemon games) are to collect Pokemon. To beat the Gym Leaders, you must use your collected Pokemon to fight the Gym Leader's Pokemon.</p>

    <img src="/Images/pokemonSword.webp" class="imgcenter" alt="An image of Pokemon" title="Pokemon Sword">

    <p>The above screenshot highlights the optional sub-objective of battling the Pokemon Landorus. While collecting powerful Pokemon like this one is a sub-objective, it will also help the player with their primary objective of defeating the gym leaders and obtaining the title of Pokemon League Champion.</p>

    <p>Remember to keep the objective consistent with player experience and the game's theme!</p>

    <h1>Game Mechanics</h1>

    <p>Game mechanics are how the player controls the game and consist of rules regarding the movement of player characters, environment allowances, and the general rules of a game. Game mechanics also includes how a game reacts to player controls which will also follow a set of rules.</p>

    <p>These mechanics include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The space of a game: the setting of the game.</li>
        <br>
        <li>State of the game: this could include player score or health, current level, or other important game variables.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Actions: these are the options available to our player that can affect the game state, such as character movement.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Necessary skills: the skill set the player must have in order to complete the game successfully.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Elements of chance: randomness added to the game, such as random enemy actions or something like a dice roll.             
    </ul>

    <img src="/Images/super-mario.webp" class="imgcenter" title="super mario bros" alt="An image of super mario bros">

    <p>To illustrate the concept of game mechanics, let's take the above example, Super Mario Bros. This screenshot shows Mario jumping to retrieve a mushroom that will make him big. This state mechanic of becoming big is crucial because it allows Mario to be hit twice before losing a life. Other mechanics in this game include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <br>
        <li></li>
        <br>
        <li></li>
        <br>
        <li></li>
        <br>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
