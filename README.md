# Software Developer With A Passion For Games [ðŸŽ®](/Portfolio/Project_1/index.html)

Welcome to my software developer portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and experience in software development, with a particular interest in game development and web design.

## About Me

Hello world, my name is Alex Porter and I'm a junior software developer with a strong passion for games and web design. Although my experience is primarily in software development, I have always been fascinated by the world of gaming. My goal is to combine my technical skills with my love for games to create immersive and captivating gaming experiences.

## Projects

### Project 1: My Course Work [ðŸŽ®](/Portfolio/Project_1/AboutHTML.html)

- Description: The My Course Work Repository is a comprehensive project that showcases the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course. It serves as a practical application of programming concepts and techniques learned, incorporating various programming languages and tools.

The coursework involves working with the following languages and tools:

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of web pages.
- CSS: Employed to style and enhance the visual appearance of the web pages.
- JavaScript: Utilized to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web pages.
- Python: Employed for backend development and data processing tasks.
- Git: Utilized for version control, allowing for efficient collaboration and tracking of changes.
- Bash: Used for scripting and automating repetitive tasks.
- GitHub: Serves as a remote repository for hosting the coursework files and enabling seamless collaboration.

### Project 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors 

- Description: In this classic game, the user is prompted to enter their choice as an integer: 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and  3 for Scissors. The computer's choice is generated randomly using the random module. The game logic then compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner. If the choices are the same, it's a tie. Otherwise, Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beats Paper. After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. After each round, the scores are updated accordingly based on the game's outcome. The updated scores are then displayed to the user. Lastly after the user decides not to play again, a final score summary is displayed. It shows the number of wins for the user and the computer throughout the game and a thank you for playing.

- Technologies Used: Git/GitHub, Python and VScode.

- Demo: Project can be found here.

### Project 3: Hangman [ðŸŽ®](Project_1/WelcomePage.html)

- Description: The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the HTML file, the structure of the game interface is defined. The game elements include a title, a display for the remaining guesses count, a container to show the hidden word with underscores, a container for the guess input and button, and a restart button. The CSS styles have been updated to position the elements correctly on the screen. The hidden word and guess container are centered using a flexbox layout, while the guesses left display is positioned in the top right corner. 

  The JavaScript code controls the game logic. The game starts by selecting a random word from an array of words. The word is stored as a hidden word, where each letter is represented by an underscore. The player's guesses are tracked, and the game state is maintained with variables such as correctGuesses, incorrectGuesses, and maxIncorrectGuesses.

  When the player makes a guess by clicking the "Guess" button or pressing the Enter key, the guess is processed. The input is validated to ensure it is a letter and not empty. If the guess is valid, it is converted to lowercase and trimmed. If the guess has already been made, the player is alerted. Otherwise, the guess is checked against the hidden word. If the guess is correct, the corresponding underscores in the hidden word are replaced with the guessed letter. If the guess is incorrect, the incorrectGuesses count is incremented.

  The current state of the hidden word and remaining guesses count is displayed after each guess. If the player runs out of guesses (incorrectGuesses reaches the maximum allowed value), input becomes disabled and the user cannot enter any more guesses. At this point, the player can choose to play again by clicking the "Restart" button.

- Technologies Used: Git/GitHub, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and VScode.
